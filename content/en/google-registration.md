When you register an NFID with Google, the security of your digital assets, data, and collectibles are dependant on the security of your Google account. **We therefore strongly encourage you set up [2-factor authentication for your Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid).**

If the device you're using has a biometric unlock, you'll have the option to create a passkey for faster authentication.

Apple [writes about passkeys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305) that they're "a replacement for passwords that are designed to provide websites and apps a passwordless sign-in experience that is both more convenient and more secure".

**We encourage you use NFID with passkeys, since they offer incredibly strong security and convenience for you.**

The biometric prompts that appear will be different depending on the device you're on (desktop, tablet, or mobile) and the browser you're using (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, or Brave).
