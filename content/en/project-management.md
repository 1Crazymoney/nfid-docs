There is currently no support for `dfx` on windows, so your two options are installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux as described in the Internet Computer [documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove) or use our prebuilt docker container's `dfxctl` tool.

Even if you're not on a windows machine, the `dfxctl` tool is helpful in managing your dfx projects.

View the tool and documentation on [Github](https://github.com/internet-identity-labs/dfxctl).
