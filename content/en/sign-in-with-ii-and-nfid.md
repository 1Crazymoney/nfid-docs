For those of us with an existing Internet Identity anchor that also want to sign in to applications with NFID, follow these three steps (*you'll be able to more easily add the rest of your devices if you complete these steps on your mobile phone*):
- Navigate to https://nfid.one/recover-nfid/enter-recovery-phrase
- Submit your **Internet Identity recovery phrase**
- Assuming your device has biometric unlock, elect to **Trust this device** and complete the challenge

Congratulations, you may now Sign in With NFID and retrieve your existing profiles on applications where you've already created accounts!

**Note** You will be able to sign in with Internet Identity or NFID from any of up to 10 authorized devices.
