NFID Wallet+ offers out-of-the-box UI to request user information. Currently, the only supported field is an [encrypted phone credential](sybil-resistance) to build sybil resistance into your apps, but more profile information can be made available to request from users by contacting gm@identitylabs.ooo with your needs:
- Email address
- Unencrypted phone number
- Personal information
- KYC status
