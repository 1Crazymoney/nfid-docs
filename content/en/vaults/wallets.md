## Creating a new NFID Vault Wallet address
An NFID Vault Wallet is where digital assets are stored. Their account identifiers can be found by navigating to `Receive` in the three-dot menu to the right of each wallet.

Create a new NFID Vault Wallet address by tapping "Add Wallet" on desktop or "+" button on mobile and giving it a name.

## Receiving assets to your NFID Vault Wallet address
By navigating to `Receive` in the three-dot menu to the right of each wallet, you'll see its "account identifier". You may always reach this screen by tapping the "Send/Receive" button on the top of your desktop screen or bottom of mobile.

## Sending assets from your NFID Vault Wallet address
By navigating to `Send` in the three-dot menu to the right of each wallet, you'll have the option to initiate a transaction. You may always reach this screen by tapping the "Send/Receive" button on the top of your desktop screen or bottom of mobile.

Transactions are only approved when the requisite number of Vault Members submit their approval.
