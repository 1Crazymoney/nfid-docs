NFID is a chain-agnostic smart contract wallet. Onboarding of both mainstream and crypto native users is streamlined to under 30 seconds by providing experiences they're most comfortable with. With support for social logins, web native platforms, and other wallets, NFID results in the easiest way for users to manage their keys and for developers to onboard users.

## What does NFID do?
NFID eliminates the friction to onboard users to your applications.
### Seamless onboarding
Whether they're mainstream users or crypto natives, expand your reach and onboard everyone
- **Mainstream Social Account Login & Passwordless flows:** Users can register via Google or the biometric unlock on their devices.
- **Seamless fiat flows:** Users can buy crypto from an iframe embedded on your page. No need to roll your own on-ramps.
### Seamless signatures
Your users approve and sign messages and transactions from an iframe embedded on your page for frictionless connectivity:
- **Connect wallet:** Users [connect](../developer/wallet/balances-and-transfers#balances) to share their asset balances.
- **Request transfers:** Users [sign messages and transactions](../developer/wallet/balances-and-transfers#transfers) from a preview screen for more transparency of what they're signing.
### Resist sybil attacks
Users can [prove they have a mobile phone number](../developer/credentials/mobile-phone-number-credential) that hasn't been used before with your application:
- **Verified:** Users verify with a code generated by AWS, and additionally by a fraud and bot detection API to ensure non-VOIP, non-scam numbers.
- **Unique:** The same phone number cannot exist in more than one NFID, guaranteeing only unique new users pass.
- **Private:** Phone numbers are sent hashed to preserve the privacy of your users while still giving you a unique string to index on.

## How can I use NFID?
NFID comes with a simple SDK. We support Ethereum, Polygon, and Internet Computer, with support coming soon for all other chains.
