If you're aiming to increase the number of self-custodial wallet connections for your decentralized application, NFID is the ideal solution. Most people are not willing to spend over 15 minutes downloading and setting up a wallet extension or application. This leads to only a fraction of visitors engaging with your dapp. Although custodial solutions are available to improve the onboarding process, they come with the responsibility of managing users' cryptographic material and a loss of asset interoperability.

This is where NFID Wallet's infrastructure becomes crucial. NFID allows users to self-custody a chain-agnostic wallet with as little as an email address without leaving your dapp.

1. **Grow faster.** Onboard more users than all other wallets combined.
2. **Expand farther.** New Web3 users are unlikely to own the crypto necessary to interact with your dapp. Embedded fiat flows help you scale with no additional effort.
3. **Create trust.** Customize to your color scheme and let NFID Wallet improve the relationship you have with your users with transaction previews.

And most importantly, **give your users the gift of self-custody.** We love Web3 because it inverts the relationship we have with our data. Now it's finally easy for everyone else to do the same.
