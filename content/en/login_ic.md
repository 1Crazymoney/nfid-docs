NFID is an app-less, strong portable authenticator offered by Internet Identity Labs. NFID uses FIDO-based biometrics for secure, convenient, and consistent passwordless authentication, and Dfinity's [Internet Identity](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/internet-identity-spec.adoc) service for delegating identities to each new scope. This guide explains how to integrate NFID into your web application â€” including the changes required for your login page and backend canister. Learn more about [NFID](/)

This guide assumes an Internet Computer application exists to integrate NFID with. If this is your first application, we suggest you clone our [NFID auth client demo](https://github.com/internet-identity-labs/nfid-auth-client-demo) fork of Kyle Peacock's original.

## Replacing existing identity provider
If you already have authentication set up in your Internet Computer app and want to switch your identity provider to NFID, simply change the existing `identityProvider` URL in your `authClient` to:
```
https://3y5ko-7qaaa-aaaal-aaaaq-cai.ic0.app/authenticate/?applicationName={YOUR%20APPLICATION%20NAME}#authorize
``` 
where `{YOUR%20APPLICATION%20NAME}` is the name you'd like displayed in the NFID authentication window.

## Migrating existing users
If you have existing users, their user profile type will need a has_many relationship to principals instead of a has_one.

We are working on a frontend plugin that packages a UX for your users to authenticate with both the original identity provider and NFID, as well as the rust & motoko examples for how a user_profile might migrate from a has_one to a has_many relationship with principals.

If you'd like to get started sooner, just know that this is the process and it is entirely separate from NFID.

## Open auth in new window instead of new tab
We've added an option for authentication windows to open in a new window (HOW CAN THE USER CONFIGURE THIS?). Just pass a new variable, `windowOpenerFeatures` with html options (like these default options we recommend passing) into your `authClient`:

```js
identityProvider: "https://3y5ko-7qaaa-aaaal-aaaaq-cai.ic0.app/authenticate/?applicationName={YOUR%20APPLICATION%20NAME}#authorize",
windowOpenerFeatures: 
  `left=${window.screen.width / 2 - 200}, `+
  `top=${window.screen.height / 2 - 300},` +
  `toolbar=0,location=0,menubar=0,width=400,height=600`
```
## Local NFID installation for authenticated local calls
If you need an actor to make authenticated calls locally in your project, you will need to clone our [NFID-SDK](https://github.com/internet-identity-labs/NFID-SDK) repo adjacent to your project.

```bash
cd ../nfid-sdk
# make sure you are running DFX 0.9.3
DFX_VERSION=0.9.3 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
yarn
rm -rf .dfx/local
dfx start --clean --background
cd examples/create-ic-app-react-demo
rm -rf .dfx/local
yarn deploy:local
yarn serve:nfid-frontend
```

Next, [download](https://ngrok.com/download) and extract the ngrok binary to `NFID-SDK/examples/create-ic-app-react-demo/scripts` and from within that directory run 
```bash
yarn tunnel
``` 

Copy the assigned domain from ngrok output
![running-ngrok](./running-ngrok.png)
as the TUNNEL_DOMAIN in your authClient:
```js
const APPLICATION_NAME = "Your%20App%20Name";
const TUNNEL_DOMAIN = "https://750321244b61.ngrok.io";
const PRODUCTION_NFID_URL = "https://3y5ko-7qaaa-aaaal-aaaaq-cai.ic0.app/authenticate/?applicationName="+APPLICATION_NAME+"#authorize";

loginButton.onclick = async () => {
  await authClient.login({
    onSuccess: async () => {
      handleAuthenticated(authClient);
    },
    // Use our production URL if canister is running in production
    // Otherwise use the local replica
    identityProvider:
      process.env.DFX_NETWORK === "ic"
        ? PRODUCTION_NFID_URL
        : TUNNEL_DOMAIN+"/authenticate/?applicationName="+APPLICATION_NAME+"#authorize",
    // Maximum authorization expiration is 8 days
    maxTimeToLive: days * hours * nanoseconds,
  });
};
```
