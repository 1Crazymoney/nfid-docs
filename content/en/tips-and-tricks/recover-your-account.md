If you've registered a security key, click on "Other sign in options" from the [NFID home page](https://nfid.one), enter your NFID number, and click on "Security key".

If the browser history is cleared on a device you've previously registered the biometric unlock for, click on "Other sign in options" from the [NFID home page](https://nfid.one), enter your NFID number, and click on "Platform auth on this device".

## Recovery with recovery phrase
