Every time you share an identifier, you allow other people to track your activity. For example if you give 5 applications fake names but the same email address, those 5 applications could collude to aggregate your activity with the common email address identifier.

The same is true for every other identifier, including wallet addresses.

It's for this reason we recommend being vigilant about how much of your activity to associate with any one wallet address, and create new wallet addresses when you want to keep activity private.
