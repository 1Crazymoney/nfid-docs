There are many ways to create an NFID:
- With [Google](#create-an-nfid-with-google)
- With [MetaMask](#metamask)
- With [WalletConnect](#walletconnect)
- With [Internet Identity](#create-an-nfid-with-internet-identity)
- With [Passkeys](#create-an-nfid-with-passkeys)

## Create an NFID with Google
<img src="../register-google.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

When you register an NFID with Google, the security of your digital assets, data, and collectibles are dependant on the security of your Google account. **We therefore strongly encourage you set up [2-factor authentication for your Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid).**

If the device you're using has a biometric unlock, you'll have the option to create a passkey for faster authentication.

Apple [writes about passkeys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305) that they're "a replacement for passwords that are designed to provide websites and apps a passwordless sign-in experience that is both more convenient and more secure".

**We encourage NFID be used with passkeys, since they offer incredibly strong security and convenience for you.**

The biometric prompts that appear will be different depending on the device you're on (desktop, tablet, or mobile) and the browser you're using (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, or Brave).

<img src="../security-key.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

If your device doesn't have the biometric unlock feature, you'll be offered to register a security key. **We recommend you set one up as one way to recover your NFID.**

## Create an NFID with a Web3 wallet
### MetaMask

Connecting with MetaMask means your MetaMask wallet will authenticate you to your NFID.

If the device you're using has a biometric unlock, you'll have the option to create a passkey for faster authentication.

### WalletConnect

Connecting with WalletConnect means any of your WalletConnect-compatible wallets will authenticate you to your NFID.

If the device you're using has a biometric unlock, you'll have the option to create a passkey for faster authentication.

## Create an NFID with Internet Identity
<img src="../register-ii.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

If you're familiar with the Internet Computer, chances are you've already created an Internet Identity.

NFID is built on top of Internet Identity and because of this, it's very easy to upgrade your existing Internet Identity with:
- A unified view of all your Internet Computer assets
- Support to buy, sell, and share NFTs across your wallets
- Mobile phone verification to privately prove to applications you're a unique user

### Upgrade an existing Internet Identity to NFID

<img src="../register-ii.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

When you connect your existing Internet Identity with NFID, your NFID profile will display NFTs and other tokens everywhere you've been using your Internet Identity even if the app doesn't support signing in with NFID.

There are two ways to link your existing Internet Identity with NFID so that you can sign in to applications with the same accounts whether you use NFID or Internet Identity:
- Connect with a code
- Connect with a recovery phrase

#### Connect with a code

<img src="../connect-ii.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

After entering your anchor number, clicking the "Connect" button, and completing the biometric prompt, you'll see instructions to enter registration mode with your Internet Identity in a separate browser window.

<img src="../connect-ii-instructions.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

Once you've entered registration mode for your Internet Identity, your NFID window will display a code that you'll verify the connection with.

<img src="../connect-ii-code.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

#### Connect with a recovery phrase

<img src="../connect-ii-recovery.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

If you choose to connect with a recovery phrase, you can simply use your Internet Identity recovery phrase in this window. **Make sure to check the URL of this window is a secure session with the nfid.one domain.**

### Create an NFID with Internet Identity as a new anchor

Each Internet Identity is identified by an anchor number, as is each NFID. If you don't want to manage the same anchor with NFID, you can create NFID as a new anchor by signing in with Internet Identity as you would any other dapp. Keep in mind:
- You will not be able to sign in to your existing accounts on other dapps with NFID, you will have to use Internet Identity
- You will not be able to see all your tokens and NFTs across all your dapps from your NFID profile
- You will not be able to share data you've created with your Internet Identity through NFID

### Adding a biometric or security device

In either of the above two cases, you'll have the option to create a passkey for faster authentication if the device you're using has a biometric unlock.

Apple [writes about passkeys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305) that they're "a replacement for passwords that are designed to provide websites and apps a passwordless sign-in experience that is both more convenient and more secure".

**We encourage NFID be used with passkeys, since they offer incredibly strong security and convenience for you.**

The biometric prompts that appear will be different depending on the device you're on (desktop, tablet, or mobile) and the browser you're using (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, or Brave).

#### Don't have devices with biometric unlocks?

If your device doesn't have the biometric unlock feature, you'll be offered to register a security key. **We recommend you set one up as one way to recover your NFID.**

## Create an NFID with Passkeys
<img src="../register-devices.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

Passwords are typically the first line of defense in our digital lives but are at risk of being phished or leaked in data breaches.

To address these security threats in a simpler and more convenient way, Internet users need to move towards passwordless authentication. This is where passkeys come in. Passkeys are a significantly safer replacement for passwords and other phishable authentication factors. They cannot be reused, don't leak in server breaches, and protect users from phishing attacks. Passkeys are built on industry standards, can work across different operating systems and browser ecosystems, and can be used with both websites and apps.

Apple [writes about passkeys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305) that they're "a replacement for passwords that are designed to provide websites and apps a passwordless sign-in experience that is both more convenient and more secure".

**We encourage NFID be used with passkeys since they offer incredibly strong security and convenience for you, and we encourage you register them on multiple devices in case one is lost.**

### Starting on a desktop computer

<img src="../biometric-from-desktop.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

1. Click on the "iPhone, iPad, or Android device" button to display a QR code. 
2. Scan the code with your personal phone or tablet, and follow the prompts to create your NFID.
3. When your NFID is created and if your computer supports a biometric unlock, you'll have the option to create a passkey for fast, secure authentication.

<img src="../trust-device-window.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

### Starting on a mobile device

<img src="../biometric-from-mobile.png" style="width:100%;margin:auto;padding-bottom:20px;"></img>

Click on the "Continue with enhanced security" button to prompt the biometric device unlock, and follow the prompts to complete your registration.

The biometric prompts that appear will be different depending on the device you're on (desktop, tablet, or mobile) and the browser you're using (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, or Brave).

### Registering a mobile device from a registered desktop

We do not yet have the ability for you to easily register a mobile device if your desktop is already registered, but you have other options in the meantime:
- If you've used Google, you can sign in with Google on mobile
- If you've used MetaMask, Internet Identity, or another Web3 wallet, you can sign in with them on mobile
- If you've created a recovery method like a security key or recovery phrase, you can use them on mobile

### Don't have devices with biometric unlocks?
