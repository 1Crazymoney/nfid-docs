Welcome to the NFID developer documentation. 

NFID is a pluggable auth infrastructure that streamlines the onboarding of both mainstream and crypto native users in under a minute by providing experiences that they're most comfortable with. Unlike any other identity provider, NFID automatically generates a new key for every new account without users taking any additional action.

A "wallet" is a single key. An identity layer for the internet is a "metawallet" that manages app-specific wallets and grants the user privacy-preserving superpowers by supporting zk proofs and transfers across those wallets.

Our mission with NFID is for it to become the identity layer for the internet.
