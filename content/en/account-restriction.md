By default, NFID allows users to create up to 5 accounts with your application.

If you'd like to change that number, simply reach out to hello@identitylabs.ooo with the following:
</br></br>*Subject:* 
>Request to restrict number of NFID accounts with my application 
*Body:* 
>My application's derivation origin is: {derivationOrigin}</br>The amount of accounts I'd like to limit each NFID to is: {accountLimit}

`derivationOrigin` is the originating domain that the principal ID is derived from.
`accountLimit` is a number between 1 and 5 inclusive. Your users will see two different screens depending on if you limit the number of accounts each NFID can create to 1 or more than 1.

Once we set up the configuration, we'll respond with love that you're all set!

Of course this process will be self-serve in the future, as will be all other features given that NFID will be a tokenized protocol, but we have limited resources and wanted to get this out to you as quickly as possible.
