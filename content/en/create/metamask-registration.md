Connecting with MetaMask means your MetaMask wallet will authenticate you to your NFID.

If the device you're using has a biometric unlock, you'll have the option to create a passkey for faster authentication.

Apple [writes about passkeys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305) that they're "a replacement for passwords that are designed to provide websites and apps a passwordless sign-in experience that is both more convenient and more secure".

**We encourage you use NFID with passkeys, since they offer incredibly strong security and convenience for you.**

The biometric prompts that appear will be different depending on the device you're on (desktop, tablet, or mobile) and the browser you're using (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, or Brave).

If your device doesn't have the biometric unlock feature, you'll be offered to register a security key. **We recommend you set one up as one way to recover your NFID.**
